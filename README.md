## Lab 02 / Arrays, for loops, testing
This lab is dedicated to creating, interacting with and manipulating arrays in Java. Arrays in Java have a fixed size. Arrays are created with a certain size and they never shrink or grow. Java arrays are typed. You can have an array of integers, or an array of strings, but not an array mixed with integers and strings.

## Lab 03 / Maps and File I/O
For the first two methods in todayâ€™s lab, continue working in your basiclibrary directory.

For the JS linter, create a new Java application inside of java-fundamentals by creating a new directory called linter, cding into it, and running gradle init --type java-application. Download the gates.js file, and save it in the resources directory within linter.
